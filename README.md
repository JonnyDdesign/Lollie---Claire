# Lollie & Claire

## About This Project
Lollie & Claire is a travel and blog site I created to showcase my ability to design and develop a website for a travel company. The user will have the ability to view previous trips, upcoming trips, book future trips, and read relevant blogposts.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Installation/Usage
Eventually this site will be live and can be reached at a future url to be disclosed shortly.
